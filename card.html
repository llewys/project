			<p>The raccoon is curious, clever, and solitary-- and deceptively cuddly-looking. Recognizable by its
				striped face and ringed tail, the raccoon owes the success of its population to its ability to live in a
				wide variety of habitats and to survive on an extremely flexible diet. They have been know to live over
				20 years in captivity.</p>
