In this project, I had the opportunity to demonstrate my new web development skills by re-creating a webpage from a design prototype.

This is a common workflow for front-end web developers. Typically, we'll be provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated into an actual, functional website.

The design prototype used in this project (which you can see in the image <design-prototype.png>) is inspired by trading cards and features a fish you might recognize from a popular animated film. The task is to create a card like this and swap out the fish with an animal of your choice.
